# 5.1 Key Components

Account abstraction redefines the way user accounts are managed and interacted with on the blockchain. By abstracting account management into smart contracts, account abstraction enables greater flexibility, security, and efficiency in DApps. NERO has built all the key components of account abstraction inside its own framework, including the User Operation Mempool, Bundler, and Entry Point Contract:

**User Operation Mempool:** The User Operation Mempool serves as the repository for pending user operations awaiting execution on the blockchain. It functions similarly to the traditional transaction mempool but is specifically designed to handle user operations within the context of account abstraction. When users initiate account-related operations, such as fund transfers or smart contract interactions, these operations are temporarily stored in the User Operation Mempool until they are processed by blockchain.

**Bundler:** The Bundler is responsible for packaging and bundling user operations from the User Operation Mempool into atomic bundles for execution on the blockchain. It aggregates multiple user operations into a single transaction bundle, optimizing the use of blockchain resources and reducing transaction overhead. The Bundler ensures that bundled operations are executed atomically, meaning that either all operations within the bundle are executed successfully, or none of them are, ensuring consistency and integrity across the blockchain.

**Entry Point Contract:** The Entry Point Contract serves as the interface through which users interact with their abstract accounts on the blockchain. It is a smart contract deployed on the blockchain that acts as the entry point for all user operations related to a specific abstract account. The Entry Point Contract contains the logic necessary to handle incoming user operations, such as depositing funds, withdrawing funds, or invoking custom account functions. Users interact with their abstract accounts by sending transactions to the Entry Point Contract, which then routes the operations to the appropriate account contract for execution.
