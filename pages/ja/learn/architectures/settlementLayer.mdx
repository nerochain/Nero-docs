# 2.3 Settlement layer: High-performance EVM-compatible Chain

The execution layer is key to NERO’s scalability. NERO is optimized by transferring resource-intensive transaction processing from the on-chain environment to off-chain, while retaining on-chain focus on result validation. dividing the transaction process into two phases. Initially, a multitude of transactions are executed off-chain and subsequently combined. Then, they are collectively submitted to the main chain for validation. The original transaction data is compressed and stored on-chain. This approach minimizes the volume of data transmitted to the main chain, thereby facilitating faster and more cost-effective transactions.

## 2.3.1 Full Ethereum Compatibility

NERO believes that Ethereum is the industry standard for blockchain application development. To attract more high-quality DApps projects and developers to join the NERO ecosystem, NERO has implemented the full Ethereum protocol in the settlement layer. NERO not only has full compatibility with EVM but also keeps up with the latest EIPs so that developers can directly deploy the existing DApps on Ethereum to NERO. On the other hand, all the development tools developed on Ethereum, including Wallet, Solidity, Remix, Truffle, and Hardhat, can also be directly used on the NERO Chain. Besides, NERO is also compatible with almost all of the RPC interfaces of Ethereum, so developers can switch to NERO’s application development at no cost and get the rewards for NERO’s ecosystem development.
