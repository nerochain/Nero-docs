# Model and Assumptions

Firstly, we establish the network model:

* **Topology:** Nodes are interconnected via a P2P network.
* **Maximum network delay:** The network's maximum delay is denoted as $D$. If an honest node receives specific data in the network at time $T$, then other honest nodes can acquire the same data before time $T + D$.

Subsequently, the security model is outlined as follows:

* Detection of any invalid block is guaranteed, as at least one honest node in the network will uncover and disseminate it.
* Each honest node maintains connections with at least one other honest node.
