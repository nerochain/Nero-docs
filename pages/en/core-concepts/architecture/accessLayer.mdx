# Access Layer: Native Account Abstraction

The Access Layer, with native account abstraction, functions as the gateway for users to engage with the blockchain network. This layer facilitates various user activities, including account creation, transaction signing, and smart contract interaction. By abstracting the intricacies of blockchain protocols, it simplifies user interactions while upholding security measures. Native account abstraction enables users to manage their accounts and transactions seamlessly, offering flexibility in key management and transaction processing. This layer ensures a smooth and user-friendly experience, enhancing accessibility and usability within the blockchain environment.

Additionally, the Access Layer decouples user access from the core blockchain, like the shell component in computer operating systems. This separation facilitates future updates and upgrades to access technologies.
