# Overview

Flexibility of the blockchain need to be increased in order to address the issues. Therefore, we propose NERO, a next-generation modular blockchain featuring native abstract account mechanism, that is secure, scalable, and most importantly, flexible. NERO introduces a more structured and native mechanism for account abstraction, including integrated smart contracts, user operation pool, Paymaster, and more. This enables users to navigate the Web3 world with the familiarity of web2 experiences. Additionally, NERO has devised a gas fee economics model that empowers DApps by sharing the gas fee according to the contribution, encouraging DApps to make every effort to optimize themselves. Moreover, NERO adopts a modular design to ensure high-performance transaction processing. The entire process is vertically divided into execution, settlement, and data availability. along with a settlement chain fully compatible with EVM and Ethereum protocols, with consensus which supports large-scale node participation. And its data availability is based on data sampling validation schemes, which currently has the highest efficiency.

NERO is designed to collaborate with and support the development of dApps within its ecosystem. It establishes a novel foundation by leveraging a high-performance underlying permissionless blockchain, gradually adding flexibility enhancement in phases. NERO actively supports the development of Web 3.0 through innovative concepts, forming a permissionless blockchain with complete underlying capabilities that everyone can participate in. Compared with other permissionless blockchains, NERO is committed to making innovations and contributions in flexibility as well as transaction scaling, with the following 5 core technical features:

- Utilizing native account abstraction for a Web2-like user experience
- Blockspace 2.0: Implementing a multidimensional gas fee economy with transaction fee redistribution across the ecosystem dApps
- Employing a pipelined optimized BFT consensus mechanism, ensuring high throughput, decentralization, security, and fast transaction confirmation
- Ensuring full compatibility with Ethereum protocols and EVM, facilitating seamless application migration within the ecosystem
