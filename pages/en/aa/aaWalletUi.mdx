  <p style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>Figure 14: Login 3</p>
</div>

3. After selecting the NERO wallet, you will be prompted to provide some account information to set up the wallet. In the provided field, you can enter your preferred social media account, email address, or phone number that you would like associated with the wallet.
4. Once you have entered the account information, review it to ensure it is accurate. Then, locate and click the "Continue" button at the bottom of the screen.
5. Clicking the Continue button will initiate the wallet creation process. The AA Wallet UI will handle the backend setup and linking of your account information to the NERO wallet.
6. Upon successful wallet creation, you should see the main NERO wallet interface load, indicating that the setup process is complete.

**Note:** Even if you login with other wallets like **Bitget Wallet** or **Gate Wallet**, you will still be logged in as an AA Wallet.

## Wallet Home

  <p style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>Figure 15: Home</p>
</div>

The home screen provides a clean and intuitive interface where users can view their total NERO balance prominently displayed at the top. Below that, users will find two main action buttons: Send for initiating transfers and Receive for displaying the wallet address.
The screen features three tabs for different functionalities:
Tokens tab shows a list of default tokens with their respective balances:

- NERO (native token)
- DAI
- USDT
- USDC

NFTs tab for viewing NFT collections
Activity tab for transaction history
Users can tap on any token to view its detailed information. The interface is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly, making it easy to access essential wallet functions and monitor token balances at a glance.
Note: These default tokens are pre-configured for user convenience, and additional tokens can be added using the + Import Token feature.

This comprehensive menu structure gives AA Wallet users easy access to all the key features and controls they would need to manage their digital assets effectively. The clear labeling and organization of the menu items makes the application intuitive and user-friendly.

## Payment Methods

The Select Payment Method screen in the AA Wallet application offers two distinct payment options:

### Sponsored Gas

- This payment method allows users to complete transactions without having to pay the gas fees themselves.
- The gas costs are covered by the project or platform that has integrated the AA Wallet.
- However, the Sponsored Gas option is only available if the project has specifically enabled and configured this feature on the AA Platform.
- If the Sponsored Gas option is not enabled by the project, users will not be able to select this payment method.

### Pay with Token

- This payment method gives users the ability to pay the gas fees using a specific ERC20 token.
- The project or platform integrating the AA Wallet has the ability to set which ERC20 token(s) can be used to cover the gas costs.
- The number of tokens available for use is displayed to the user (in the example, 6 tokens are available).

</div>

**Note:** Default NEROToken(NativeToken)

#### Gas fee Display

**Sponsored Gas**

- When the Sponsored Gas option is selected, the gas fee is displayed as 0, indicating that the project is covering the full gas cost for the user.
- This allows users to complete transactions without having to pay any gas fees themselves.
  <div style={{ height: "2rem" }} />

    />
    <p style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>Figure 22: Sponsor Gas Fee Display</p>
  </div>

**Pay with Token**

- When the Pay with Token option is selected, the maximum possible gas fee that the user may need to pay is displayed.
- This provides transparency to the user about the potential gas cost they may incur when using this payment method.
- The user would need to ensure they have enough of the project-specified ERC20 token to cover this maximum gas fee amount.
