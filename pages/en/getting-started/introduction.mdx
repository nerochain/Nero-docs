## What is NeroChain?

Developed for scalability, adaptability, and improved user experience, NeroChain is a developer-friendly Layer 1 modular blockchain. Natively, it features Account Abstraction (AA), which helps users quickly sign transactions without running gas from their wallets. Using the Paymaster system, dApps may allow users pay with ERC20 tokens or sponsor gas costs, therefore smoothing out transactions and providing a flawless experience. Additionally with Blockspace 2.0, NeroChain guarantees effective use of network resources by improving how transactions are handled and fees are distributed. It is completely EVM-compatible; developers may easily create strong Web3 apps by deploying smart contracts using Hardhat, Remix, and other well-known tools.

## Why build on NeroChain?

Nerochain was created with a fresh perspective in mind for developers investigating blockchains: one that values applications instead of monopolizing them at the infrastructure level.

### Applications Capture Their True Value
In traditional blockchains, regardless of how good an application is, the infrastructure is always the true winner. Gas costs are paid in the chain's native cryptocurrency, thus the blockchain is the principal benefactor of each transaction. This results in a system in which apps produce value, but most of this value is extracted by the underlying network.
Nero flips this model by introducing an economic structure where applications share in the network's success. Developers no longer need to surrender transaction volume to the chain itself - they can retain and redistribute value in ways that directly benefit their users and ecosystems.
And more, by enabling gas payments with ERC20 tokens, developers can boost their token utility by driving sustainable demand and revenue for their projects. This means a special thing: If developers' project drives motion, so will their tokens, but with a way more potential for value.

### Blockspace 2.0: Redefining How Transactions Work

Nero proposes Blockspace 2.0, a step beyond the inflexible gas models of older blockchain systems. Instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach to transaction costs, Nerochain allows:
- Dynamic charge structures allow apps to establish their own transaction cost models.
- Gas sponsorship via Paymaster allows developers to subsidize expenses and enhance UX.
- Fee-sharing techniques enable dApps to get a share of the transaction fees they produce.

This implies that apps are no longer competing with their own infrastructure for economic viability. Blockspace becomes an asset that dApps may optimize and use, rather than a burden they must bear.
