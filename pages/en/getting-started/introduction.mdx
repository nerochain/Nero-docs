# NERO Chain: What, Why, and How for Developers

## What is NERO Chain?

Fundamentally scalable, flexible, and with enhanced user experience in mind, NERO Chain is a Layer 1 modular blockchain fit for developers. NERO Chain distinguishes itself by native account abstraction (AA) and Paymaster (with an API platform for easy configuration), which helps developers create new and frictionless experiences for users while having more of their application value generated back for themselves. Developers find NERO Chain attractive due to its essential characteristics.

- **Native Account Abstraction**: Built-in support for ERC-4337 removes the need for any consensus layer modifications.
- **Paymaster System**: Allows dApps to let users pay with ERC20 tokens or sponsor gas costs entirely, with a Paymaster Platform to configure all of this on the fly.
- **Blockspace 2.0**:  By means of better transaction processing and fee distribution leveraging an effective revenue-sharing system, Blockspace 2.0 guarantees effective use of network resources.
- **Complete EVM Compatibility**: No learning conflict or migration. Using familiar tools such as Solidity, Hardhat, Remix, and other popular programming environments, create and use smart contracts.

## Why Build on NERO Chain?

With a fresh perspective on blockchain technology, NERO Chain prioritizes applications over infrastructure-level value extraction.

### Applications that capture their true value

Gas, the native currency of the chain, ensures that the blockchain reaps the maximum benefit from every transaction. This leads to a system in which apps generate value, with the underlying network extracting the majority of it.

The NERO Chain introduces an economic framework that allows apps to participate in the network's success, a concept that many find upsetting. Developers may keep and share value in ways that directly benefit their users and ecosystems, therefore negating the need to turn transaction value over to the chain itself.

Through creating sustainable demand and income for their systems, developers may improve the token value by allowing gas payments using ERC20 tokens. The result means something special: If your project drives activity, so will your tokens, but with significantly more value potential.

### Seamless User Experience

User interactions’ intricacy has been one of the main obstacles to blockchain acceptance. NERO Chain addresses this via:

- **Gasless Transactions**: Depending on how the application developer enables the types of payment, users can interact with dApps without owning the native token or not having tokens at all.  
- **Smart Contract Wallets**: Enhanced security and recovery options compared to EOAs. We can enable social logins and much more through account abstraction.
- **Bundled Transactions**: A single transaction can execute multiple actions.

This means your applications have the tools that can onboard users who have never interacted with blockchain before, removing the friction that has historically limited Web3 adoption.
## How to Get Started with NERO Chain

With NERO Chain’s EVM compatibility and developer-friendly tools, starting with its development is simple.

1. **Set Up Your Environment**: Use known tools like Hardhat, Remix, or Truffle for contract development.
2. **Access the Testnet**:  Connect to NERO Chain’s Testnet for development and testing. Access the mainnet to deploy it to production.
3. **Integrate Account Abstraction**:  Use the UserOpSDK to implement AA features and connect with the Paymaster API.
4. **Leverage the Paymaster**: Enable flexible gas payment options for your users.
