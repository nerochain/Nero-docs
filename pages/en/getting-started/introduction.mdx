# Nerochain: What, Why, and How for Developers

## What is Nerochain?

Fundamentally scalable, flexible, and with enhanced user experience in mind, Nerochain is a Layer 1 modular blockchain fit for developers. Nerochain distinguishes itself by native Account Abstraction (AA) and the Paymaster (with an API platform for easy configuration), which helps developers to create new and frictionless experiences for the users while having more of their own application value generated back for themselves.
Key features that make Nerochain a preferred choice for developers include:

- **Native Account Abstraction**: Built-in support for ERC-4337, eliminating the need for any consensus layer changes.
- **Paymaster System**: Allows dApps to let users pay with ERC20 tokens or sponsor gas costs entirely, with a Paymaster Platform to configure all of this on the fly.
- **Blockspace 2.0**: Ensures efficient use of network resources through improved transaction handling and fee distribution leveraging a efficient fee-sharing mechanism.
- **Complete EVM Compatibility**: No migration or learning friction. Create and deploy smart contracts using familiar tools like Solidity, Hardhat, Remix, and other popular development environments.

## Why Build on Nerochain?

Nerochain was created with a fresh perspective for developers exploring blockchain technology; one that prioritizes **applications** rather than extracting value at the infrastructure level.

### Applications that capture their true value

In traditional blockchains, regardless of an application's quality, the infrastructure always comes out on top. Gas costs are paid in the chain's native cryptocurrency, making the blockchain the primary beneficiary of every transaction. This creates a system where applications generate value, but most of this value is extracted by the underlying network.

Nerochain disrupts this model by introducing an economic structure where applications share in the network's success. Developers no longer need to surrender transaction value to the chain itself - they can retain and redistribute value in ways that directly benefit their users and ecosystems.

By enabling gas payments with ERC20 tokens, developers can enhance their token utility by driving sustainable demand and revenue for their projects. This means something special: If your project drives activity, so will your tokens, but with significantly more value potential.

### Seamless User Experience

User interactions' intricacy has been one of the main obstacles to blockchain acceptance. Nerochain addresses this via:

- **Gasless Transactions**: Depending on how the application developer enables the types of payment, users can interact with dApps without owning the native token, or not having tokens at all.  
- **Smart Contract Wallets**: Enhanced security and recovery options compared to EOAs. We can enable social logins, and many more from account abstraction.
- **Bundled Transactions**: Multiple actions can be executed in a single transaction

This means your applications have the tools that can onboard users who have never interacted with blockchain before, removing the friction that has historically limited Web3 adoption.

## How to Get Started with Nerochain

With Nerochain's EVM compatibility and developer-friendly tools, starting with its development is simple. 

1. **Set Up Your Environment**: Use known tools like Hardhat, Remix, or Truffle for contract development.
2. **Access the Testnet**: Connect to Nerochain's Testnet for development and testing. Access the Mainnet to deploy it to production.
3. **Integrate Account Abstraction**: Use the UserOpSDK to implement AA features and connect with the Paymaster API.
4. **Leverage the Paymaster**: Enable flexible gas payment options for your users.
