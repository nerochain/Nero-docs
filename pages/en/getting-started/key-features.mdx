# Key Features for Developers

This section provides a high-level overview of NERO Chain's key features that make it an ideal platform for developers. Knowing these characteristics will enable you to fully use NERO Chain for developing your apps.

## Native Account Abstraction

Using a native ERC-4337 Account Abstraction implementation, NERO Chain provides developers with advanced tools allowing them to construct better user experiences:

#### Smart Contract Wallets

Unlike traditional Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), smart contract wallets on NERO Chain provide:

- **Programmable Authorization**: Implement any verification logic for transaction approval.
- **Multi-signature Support**: Require multiple signers for transaction authorization.
- **Social Recovery**: Enable account recovery through trusted friends or services.
- **Session Keys**: Implement limited-use keys for specific applications or time periods.

#### UserOperation and Bundlers

At the core of Account Abstraction is the `UserOperation` object:

- **Flexible Transaction Format**: Completely separates the user's intent from the transaction execution.
- **Bundlers**: Specialized nodes that package multiple UserOperations into a single transaction.
- **Mempool Management**: Dedicated mempool for UserOperations enhances predictability.


## Paymaster System

The Paymaster is a core component that enables flexible gas payment mechanisms. And the AA-Platform gives the developer an easy-to-use way to configure everything on the fly. 

#### Payment Options

- **Sponsored Transactions (Free)**: Developers can fully cover gas costs for users.
- **ERC20 Token Payments**: Users can pay gas fees using supported ERC20 tokens instead of NERO.
- **Pre-fund/Post-fund Models**: Choose between upfront payments or after-execution settlements.

#### Integration Benefits

- **Token Utility**: Increase your token's utility by enabling it for gas payments.
- **User Experience**: Remove the need for users to own NERO tokens to interact with your dApp.
- **Flexible Pricing Models**: Implement subscription models, free trials, or per-action pricing.

## Blockspace 2.0

Regarding fees, conventional blockchain systems handle every transaction the same. With Blockspace 2.0, a breakthrough approach to controlling transaction costs and resources, NERO Chain transforms that, guaranteeing flexibility, efficiency, and justice.

#### Unique UX with Smarter Fees

- **Custom price models**: Developers may create unique price models for their particular demands, therefore matching expenses with those of their consumers.
- **Fee Sharing**: Should your dApp create transactions, users and developers stand to gain from a split of the network fees.
- **Stable Pricing**: NERO's approach seeks a more predictable charge structure than wild fluctuations in conventional gas prices.

#### Better Use of Resources 
- Bundled Transactions - Consider it as carpooling for transactions; NERO arranges them to save unwarranted expenses.
- Like an express lane on a freeway, urgent transactions are handled quicker in priority lanes.
- Effective resource allocation helps developers better estimate the processing power a software requires, therefore lessening surprises.

With Blockspace 2.0, NERO Chain is creating smarter, more sustainable, better for everyone rather than only lowering costs.
