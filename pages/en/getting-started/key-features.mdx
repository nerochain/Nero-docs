# Key Features for Developers

This section provides a highlevel overview of Nerochain's key features that make it an ideal platform for developers. Knowing these characteristics will enable you to fully use Nerochain for developing your apps.

## Native Account Abstraction

Using a native ERC-4337 Account Abstraction implementation, Nerochain provides developers with advanced tools allowing them to construct better user experiences:

#### Smart Contract Wallets

Unlike traditional Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), smart contract wallets on Nerochain provide:

- **Programmable Authorization**: Implement any verification logic for transaction approval.
- **Multi-signature Support**: Require multiple signers for transaction authorization.
- **Social Recovery**: Enable account recovery through trusted friends or services.
- **Session Keys**: Implement limited-use keys for specific applications or time periods.

#### UserOperation and Bundlers

At the core of Account Abstraction is the `UserOperation` object:

- **Flexible Transaction Format**: Completely separates the user's intent from the transaction execution.
- **Bundlers**: Specialized nodes that package multiple UserOperations into a single transaction.
- **Mempool Management**: Dedicated mempool for UserOperations enhances predictability.


## Paymaster System

The Paymaster is a core component that enables flexible gas payment mechanisms:

#### Payment Options

- **Sponsored Transactions (Free)**: Developers can fully cover gas costs for users.
- **ERC20 Token Payments**: Users can pay gas fees using supported ERC20 tokens instead of NERO.
- **Pre-fund/Post-fund Models**: Choose between upfront payments or after-execution settlements.

#### Integration Benefits

- **Token Utility**: Increase your token's utility by enabling it for gas payments.
- **User Experience**: Remove the need for users to own NERO tokens to interact with your dApp.
- **Flexible Pricing Models**: Implement subscription models, free trials, or per-action pricing.

## Blockspace 2.0

Nero proposes Blockspace 2.0, a step beyond the inflexible gas models of older blockchain systems. Instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach to transaction costs, Nerochain allows:

#### Dynamic Fee Structure

- **App-specific Fee Models**: Create custom fee structures for your application.
- **Fee Sharing Mechanism**: Capture a portion of the transaction fees generated by your dApp.
- **Predictable Costs**: More stable fee environment compared to traditional gas markets.

#### Resource Optimization

- **Efficient Transaction Bundling**: Reduce overhead through intelligent transaction packaging.
- **Priority Lanes**: Ensure critical transactions are processed promptly.
- **Resource Allocation**: More predictable resource consumption for your application.
