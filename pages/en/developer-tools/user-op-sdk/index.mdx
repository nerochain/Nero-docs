# UserOpSDK: Account Abstraction SDK

Designed as a potent JavaScript/TypeScript tool, the UserOpSDK streamlines UserOperations on NERO Chain creation, signing, and transmission. This piece will assist you to use Account Abstraction capabilities in your dApp by using the SDK.

The UserOpSDK provides access to fundamental Account Abstraction functionality on NERO Chain, with capabilities such as:

- Creating UserOperations for contract calls and transfers
- Signing UserOperations with Ethereum signers
- Communicating with bundlers to execute transactions
- Integrating with Paymasters to sponsor gas or accept ERC-20 tokens
- Creating and managing smart contract wallets

This section helps you get started with the SDK and provides examples of common operations.
