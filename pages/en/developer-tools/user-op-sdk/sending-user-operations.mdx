# Sending UserOperations

Once your UserOperation is configured, you can send it to the network. This section covers the process of sending operations and handling the results.

## Sending the UserOperation

```typescript
try {
  // Send the UserOperation
  const result = await client.sendUserOperation(builder);
  
  // Get the transaction hash
  const userOpHash = result.userOpHash;
  console.log("UserOperation hash:", userOpHash);
  
  // Wait for the transaction to be mined
  const receipt = await result.wait();
  console.log("Transaction hash:", receipt.transactionHash);
  
  return receipt;
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error sending UserOperation:", error);
  throw error;
}
```

## Monitoring UserOperation Status

After sending a UserOperation, you can monitor its status:

1. First, you get the `userOpHash` from the result of `sendUserOperation`.
2. Then, you can use `wait()` on the result to wait for the operation to be included in a block.
3. The receipt contains the transaction hash that can be used to look up details on a block explorer.
