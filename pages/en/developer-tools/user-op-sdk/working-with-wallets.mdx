# Working with AA Wallets

Account Abstraction wallets are deterministically generated for each EOA wallet. This section covers how to work with these AA wallets.

## Getting the AA Wallet Address

Each EOA wallet has a corresponding AA wallet address that's deterministically generated:

```typescript
// Get the AA wallet address (works even if not yet deployed on-chain)
const aaWalletAddress = await builder.getSender();
console.log("AA Wallet Address:", aaWalletAddress);
```

## Checking AA Wallet Deployment Status

You can check if an AA wallet has already been deployed:

```typescript
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(NERO_RPC_URL);
const code = await provider.getCode(aaWalletAddress);
const isDeployed = code !== '0x';
console.log("Wallet deployed:", isDeployed);
```
