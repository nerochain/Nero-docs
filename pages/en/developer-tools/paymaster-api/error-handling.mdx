# Error Handling

Proper error handling is essential when integrating with the Paymaster API. This section covers common errors you may encounter and best practices for a robust implementation.

## Common Error Codes

Interacting with the Paymaster API like sending transactions can return standard JSON-RPC errors in those scenarios. Here are common error codes and their meanings:


Many of these errors will also be accompanied by an additional error message from the EntryPoint.

|Code	| Description|
|------------|-------------|
|-32521	| Transaction reverted (or will revert) during execution phase.|
|-32602	| Invalid UserOperation struct/fields.|
|-32500	| Transaction rejected by entryPoint's simulateValidation, during account creation or validation.|
|-32501	| Transaction rejected by paymaster's validatePaymasterUserOp.|
|-32502	| Transaction rejected because of opcode validation.|
|-32503	| UserOperation out of time-range: either account or paymaster returned a time-range, and it is already expired (or will expire soon).|
|-32504	| Transaction rejected because paymaster (or signature aggregator) is throttled/banned.|
|-32505	| Transaction rejected because paymaster (or signature aggregator) stake or unstake-delay is too low.|
|-32506	| Transaction rejected because account specified unsupported signature aggregator.|
|-32507	| Either validateUserOp or validatePaymasterUserOp returned an invalid signature check.|

## Common Specific Errors

Bundler error codes often are accompanied by an additional AAxx code provided by the EntryPoint to give additional guidance.

- AA1x error codes relate to creating an account
- AA2x error codes relate to the sender of the user operation
- AA3x error codes relate to paymasters
- AA4x error codes relate to verification generally
- AA5x errors relate to actions after the user operation was executed
