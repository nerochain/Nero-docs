# Paymaster API

The Nerochain Paymaster API enables developers to implement gas abstraction in their dApps, allowing users to pay gas fees with ERC20 tokens or have transactions sponsored entirely. This guide covers the API endpoints, request/response formats, and best practices for integration.

## Introduction

The Paymaster API sits between your dApp and the Nerochain blockchain, providing services to:

1. Sponsor gas fees for your users
2. Allow users to pay for gas with ERC20 tokens
3. Validate and sign UserOperations before they're sent to the bundler
4. Apply your configured gas strategies to user transactions
