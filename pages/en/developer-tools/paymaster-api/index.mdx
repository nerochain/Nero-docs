# Paymaster API

By letting developers use gas abstraction in their dApps, the Nerochain Paymaster API lets users pay gas costs using ERC20 tokens or have transactions sponsored totally. This guide addresses recommended practices for integration, request/response forms, and API endpoints.
## Introduction

The Paymaster API sits between your dApp and the Nerochain blockchain, providing services to:

1. Sponsor gas fees for your users.
2. Allow users to pay for gas with ERC20 tokens.
3. Validate and sign UserOperations before they're sent to the bundler.
4. Apply your configured gas strategies to user transactions.
