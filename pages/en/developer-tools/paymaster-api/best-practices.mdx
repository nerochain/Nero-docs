# Best Practices

## 1. Make use of UserOpSDK.
The SDK manages much of the complexity involved in interacting with the Paymaster API and UserOperations. Retries and built-in error handling help to greatly simplify integration.


## 2. Cache Tokens Supported
Periodically update the list of supported tokens to help to prevent frequent API requests. This lightens your servers' burden and enhances performance.

## 3. Apply appropriate error handling.
Depending on the kind of fault, always catch and treat them suitably. While certain mistakes—like network problems—might be retryable, others—like improper parameters—call for human action.

## 4. Evaluate Token Approvals
Verify users' authorized token spending for Type 1 and 2 payments before forwarding the User Operation. This enhances user experience and helps to eliminate pointless failures.

## 5. safely save API keys
Never show your API key in code written for a client. Keep it always safe on your backend systems.

## 6. Track Consumption
Track your sponsorship use on the AA Platform to prevent unplanned service outages brought on by exceeding quotas.

## 7. Establish Appropriate Gas Restraints
Get precise gas values for your UserOperations using the gas estimating approach. Appropriate restrictions maximize expenses and aid to minimize transaction failures.

## 8. Rate Limitations and Quotas
Your use of APIs is limited by the settings found in your AA Platform account:

- Daily gas limits
- Transaction count limits
- Token allowlists
- Gas price caps

You can monitor and adjust these settings in the [AA Platform](https://aa-platform.nerochain.io).
