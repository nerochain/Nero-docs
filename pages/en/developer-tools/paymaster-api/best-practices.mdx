# Best Practices

## 1. Use the UserOpSDK

The SDK handles most of the complexity of working with UserOperations and the Paymaster API. It provides built-in error handling and retries, making integration significantly easier.

## 2. Cache Supported Tokens

Store the list of supported tokens and refresh it periodically to avoid making frequent calls to the API. This improves performance and reduces the load on your servers.

## 3. Implement Proper Error Handling

Always catch and handle errors appropriately based on the error types. Some errors (like network issues) might be retryable, while others (like invalid parameters) require user intervention.

## 4. Check Token Approvals

For Type 1 and 2 payments, verify that users have approved token spending before sending the UserOperation. This prevents unnecessary failures and improves user experience.

## 5. Securely Store API Keys

Never expose your API key in client-side code. Always keep it secure on your backend services.

## 6. Monitor Usage

Keep track of your sponsorship usage through the AA Platform to avoid unexpected service interruptions due to exceeded quotas.

## 7. Set Appropriate Gas Limits

Use the gas estimation method to get accurate gas values for your UserOperations. Setting appropriate limits helps prevent transaction failures and optimize costs.

## 8. Rate Limits and Quotas

Your API usage is subject to the limits configured in your AA Platform account:

- Daily gas limits
- Transaction count limits
- Token allowlists
- Gas price caps

You can monitor and adjust these settings in the [AA Platform](https://aa-platform.nerochain.io).
