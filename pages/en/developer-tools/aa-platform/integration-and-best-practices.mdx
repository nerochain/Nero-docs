# Integration and Best Practices

## Integration with Your Application

Once you've configured your API keys and strategies, integrate them into your application:

```typescript
// Configure your paymaster in your application
builder.setPaymasterOptions({
  apikey: "YOUR_API_KEY_FROM_PLATFORM",
  rpc: "https://paymaster-testnet.nerochain.io",
  type: 0 // Use your configured strategy type
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Limits**: Begin with conservative gas and usage limits until you understand your application's patterns.
2. **Monitor Regularly**: Check your dashboard frequently to spot unusual activity.
3. **Multiple Strategies**: Create different strategies for different user actions or user tiers.
4. **Separate Development Keys**: Use separate API keys for development and production.
5. **Maintain Adequate Funding**: For sponsored transactions, always keep sufficient funds in your account.

## Security Recommendations

- Store API keys in secure environment variables
- Implement rate limiting in your application
- Monitor usage for unusual patterns
- Restrict API key usage to specific domains
- Keep your API keys confidential
