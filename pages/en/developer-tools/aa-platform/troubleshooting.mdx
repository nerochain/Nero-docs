# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

- **API Key Rate Limiting**: If you're seeing rate limit errors, check your key's usage patterns and consider increasing limits.
- **Strategy Rejection**: If transactions are being rejected, verify that your strategy parameters match your application's needs.
- **Insufficient Funds**: Ensure your sponsorship account is adequately funded for Type 0 strategies.
- **User Payment Failure**: For Type 1/2 strategies, ensure users have sufficient token balances and have approved the paymaster contract.

## Debugging Tips

1. **Check API Key Status**: Verify the API key is active and has enough requests remaining
2. **Verify Network Settings**: Confirm you're using the correct network endpoints (testnet vs mainnet)
3. **Inspect Transaction Logs**: UserOperations failures often have detailed error codes that help diagnose issues
4. **Monitor Dashboard**: The AA Platform dashboard provides usage statistics and error information
