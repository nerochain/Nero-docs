## API Key Security

Your API keys grant access to your gas sponsorship resources. To keep them secure:

- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Use environment variables to store keys in your backend
- Implement domain restrictions for production keys
- Rotate keys periodically
- Set appropriate usage limits

## Next Steps

After creating your API keys, you should:
- [Configure your policies](/en/developer-tools/aa-platform/configuring-policies) to determine how users pay for gas
- [Manage your payment](/en/developer-tools/aa-platform/payment-management) to ensure your services remain funded
