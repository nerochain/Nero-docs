# 3.4 ZK Stacks

In order to expand the ecosystem further, NERO plans to open up its zero-knowledge capabilities in the future, making it convenient for developers to build their own logic of execution layer based on NERO's zk capabilities. We refer to these toolkits as the ZK Stacks.

The ZK Stacks represents a powerful suite of tools and capabilities that empower developers to leverage zk technology in building next-generation DApps within the NERO ecosystem. By providing the infrastructure and support necessary for zk integration, the zk stack accelerates the adoption of privacy-preserving and scalable solutions, driving the continued growth and evolution of DeFi and other blockchain applications.
