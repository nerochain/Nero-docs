Each member of the team can be assigned a role, which determines their level of access and permissions.

The AA platform provides three distinct roles to effectively manage your team and ensure smooth operations. Each role has specific permissions, providing the flexibility to assign responsibilities based on team members needs. The available roles are: Owner, Admin, and Team member.

#### Owner
The Owner role is typically assigned to the person who creates the team. Owners have the highest level of access and control, including Managing instances, oversee billing, and configure team settings.

#### Admin
Admins are trusted team members granted additional responsibilities by the Owner. They can perform most of the same tasks as the Owner, except they cannot manage billing-related details.

#### Team member (Colleague)
Team Members are general users with limited permissions. Their role mainly involves instance management, and they cannot modify team settings or access billing details.
